- **Cryptocurrency Payments**: Supports Ether payments via MetaMask.
- **Google Maps Integration**: Enables location-based ride management.
- **Transparency and Trust**: All transactions recorded on the blockchain for accountability.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Development Tools**: Truffle, Ganache
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Payment Gateway**: MetaMask
- **Location Services**: Google Maps API
